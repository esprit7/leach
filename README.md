Implementation of LEACH algorithm in Java

This program was written as an exercise of [MSc in Computer Information Systems](https://www.eap.gr/en/courses/132-master-s-in-information-systems-msc) of [Greek Open University](https://www.eap.gr/en/), course [PLS-62 Specialization in Networks and Communications](https://www.eap.gr/en/courses/228-master-s-in-information-systems-msc/course-stucture/1615-pls62-specialization-in-networks-and-communications). It is actually the answer of Question 5b of the 2nd Exercise for academic year 2017-2018.

It takes the number of nodes and rounds, and given a possibility it returns a verbose output of clusterheads per round.
